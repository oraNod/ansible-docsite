**NEW/UPDATED COMMUNITY COLLECTIONS**

These Community Collections have recently been moved out of [community.general](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general) and [community.network](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/network). They have now released version 1.0.0 and will be contained in the next Ansible 2.10 release. [Here](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/discussions/117#discussioncomment-108048)'s a detailed description of the related content move.

* [community.postgresql](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/postgresql) 1.0.0
* [community.docker](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/docker) 1.0.0
* [community.routeros](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/routeros) 1.0.0

We're also working on standing up the following collections:

* [community.google](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.google)
* [community.kubevirt](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.kubevirt)

**UPCOMING CHANGES TO THE AWX PROJECT**

In an upcoming release of AWX, custom virtual environments will be removed in favor of Execution Environments. The major changes include:
* Separation of Control Plane and Execution Plane
* Removal of "Docker Compose" Installation Mode

To learn more about Execution Environments and what the associated changes entail, read [Shane McDonald's email to the awx-project mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/awx-project/c/47MjWSUQaOc).

**DIVERSITY & INCLUSION WORKING GROUP MEETING**

We are setting up a time for the D&I working group to meet. If you would like to join, please indicate your preferred times in [this doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/vz5354kqyhvqvcs5). Don't worry about the date options that are in the past, please regard them as references to the day of the week (Monday, Tuesday etc.) that you will generally be available to attend the meeting.

**CONTRIBUTOR SUMMIT SURVEY RESULTS**

[Greg](https://twitter.com/Gwmngilfen) has the initial high-level summaries from the recent Ansible Contributor Survey ready for the community to read - you can find them [here](https://stats.eng.ansible.com/apps/docs/CS_oct2020_analysis.html). We are planning some deeper analysis now that we have done 3 surveys, so stay tuned for that.

**CONTENT FROM THE ANSIBLE COMMUNITY**

In this [blog post](https://dev-sec.io/blog/2020-10-11-ansible-collection/), [Sebastian Gumprich](https://github.com/rndmh3ro) talks about how they moved the [Ansible roles](https://github.com/dev-sec/?q=ansible-&type=&language=) in [DevSec Hardening Framework](https://dev-sec.io/) into a collection, what challenges they faced and how they overcome them.

The latest post [Getting started with Ansible](https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/) from [XLAB Steampunk](https://steampunk.si/) is about current Ansible usage, by [Tadej Borovšak](https://github.com/tadeboro).
