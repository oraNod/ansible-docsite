> The `community.hashi_vault` collection is still looking for [feedback on implementing dedicated kv plugins and modules](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/discussions/229), come join the discussion and help shape new HashiCorp Vault content.

[andersson007_](https://matrix.to/#/@andersson007_:matrix.org) shared

> As the number of collections contained in the `ansible` package continues to grow, we'd love to hear your opinions on the [Future of ansible package community topic](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/82). Among other things, we discuss the following questions:
>
> * What do you see the purpose of the `ansible` package is?
> * Should we keep the process as-is, in other words, continue to include new collections?
> * Should we stop including new collections as they can be easily installed from Ansible Galaxy anyway?
> * Should we tighten the rules for new collections to get in, for example, requiring them to be "generic"?
> 
> Please share your thoughts with the Community!
