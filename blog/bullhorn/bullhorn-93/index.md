> ### Contributor Summit & Community Survey
> 
> As usual after a Contributor Summit event, I've put together a survey to help us learn for next time. It also covers more general questions about how the community feels to you at the moment, so even if you couldn't make it to the Contributor event, or CfgMgmtCamp, it's still worth a look. [It should take just a few minutes](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/W9SWQ9Q)!
> 
> (And on the topic, if you didn't see last week's post about feedback on the Community Strategy for 2023, [check that out too](https://ansible.github.io/community/posts/state_of_the_community_2023.html)!)

[Ranabir Chakraborty](https://matrix.to/#/@ridetotheroots:matrix.org) said

> We are a new initiative called "[Ansible Middleware](https://github.com/ansible-middleware)", which utilizes the power of Ansible automation to orchestrate the installation, configuration, and management of Enterprise Middleware using several [collections](https://galaxy.ansible.com/middleware_automation). It provides you with several benefits such as a smoother release process, the same level of comfort as cloud infrastructure, making your application a first-class citizen of the Ansible ecosystem, and also making your middleware products easy to use and easy to automate. Currently, we have collections of [WildFly](https://galaxy.ansible.com/middleware_automation/wildfly), [Keycloak](https://galaxy.ansible.com/middleware_automation/keycloak), [Infinispan](https://galaxy.ansible.com/middleware_automation/infinispan), [JWS](https://galaxy.ansible.com/middleware_automation/jws), [Active MQ](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq), [Jcliff](https://galaxy.ansible.com/middleware_automation/jcliff) and we are rapidly growing.

> * We are planning to combine several pytest plugins like pytest-ansible, pytest-molecule & pytest-ansible-units into one, the idea is to pick the necessary features we need from each plugin, add the features which are missing/the ones we need and make the pytest-ansible plugin a common package for all the unit-testing work.
> 
> * We have opened a discussion for the same, you can follow it [here](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/203) and we look forward to any suggestions, feedback related to it. üòÑ

Please look at [the discussion (in particular at the bottom)](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/53) and/or [participate in the vote](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/205)!

## COMMUNITY UPDATES üëÇÔ∏è

[dmsimard](https://matrix.to/#/@dmsimard:matrix.org) shared

> In this new blog post, we run benchmarks to find out the difference between running ansible-core 2.11 and 2.14 with python 3.9 and 3.11. Then, using the same methodology, we benchmark ara's different database backends. [Check it out.](https://ara.recordsansible.org/blog/2023/02/26/benchmarking-ara-with-different-databases-and-python3.11-for-fun-and-science/)
> 
> TL;DR:
> * ansible-core 2.14 is faster than 2.11
> * python 3.11 is faster than 3.9
> * django's mysql and postgresql performance is similar
> * sqlite is slower but mostly attributable to lack of multi-threading

> Earlier this week there were 2 Ansible community meetups on the same day, one in M√ºnich and the other in Z√ºrich.

> Ansible Community Day India which happened in Pune (Red Hat Pune office on Saturday 25th February) was a day-long community-focused event to talk about Ansible project, community and wider ecosystem. It was an effort where the Ansible community both upstream and downstream meet in person to discuss about ansible and related things and kick start our events for pan India. This gave the opportunity to revive the old connections and get to make new ones.

[Sagar Paul](https://matrix.to/#/@sagpaul:matrix.org) said

> We had an in-person Ansible community day event in Pune, India. We were joined by ~82 attendees from all over the county. We had 6 talks and 2 workshops. These talks touched on different aspects of Ansible, including ansible-navigator, AWX, Network automation, and Middleware products automation. Overall, it was a great event full of productive discussion and enthusiasm from all the attendees to join the Ansible community and contribute. üéâ
