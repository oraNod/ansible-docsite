**PROPOSAL: ANSIBLE AND MATRIX**

Please check out [Greg Sutcliffe](https://twitter.com/gwmngilfen)'s detailed [blog post](https://ansible.github.io/community/posts/matrix_and_ansible.html) about where we'd like to see the Ansible Community go next with chat, and share your comments/feedback [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/og5y0l/ansible_and_matrix/).

**CONTENT FROM THE ANSIBLE COMMUNITY**

[Nicolas Leiva](https://github.com/nleiva) wrote about ["How to consistently run temporary workloads on AWS and save money"](https://nleiva.medium.com/how-you-can-consistently-run-temporary-workloads-in-the-cloud-37140b4b5e55?sk=9ff5e4a78e59e034e7eed4acdd54af58), the first of four blog posts on creating reproducible Linux environment in AWS with Ansible.

**THE ANSIBLE TEAM IS HIRING**

Red Hat is hiring a [Senior Software Engineer](https://global-redhat.icims.com/jobs/86822/senior-software-engineer--ansible/job) to work on Ansible. Please check the job description in the link and apply!

**ANSIBLE CONTRIBUTOR SUMMIT AND SURVEY** 

[Ansible Contributor Summit 2021.06](https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202106) was held last month (June 8, 2021), and we have put together a [Contributor Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/3YBYKTS). Please take a few minutes to fill it in, whether you have attended all/part/none of the event.

Feedback is really important to us so we can keep on improving the Contributor Experience for our wonderful Ansible Community. If you missed the event or want to recap parts from it, the logs, presentations, and recordings are available in the [Ansible Community wiki](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/Contributor-Summit#ansible-contributor-summit-202106---virtual-june-8-2021). 

The [next Contributor Summit](https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109) will be on September 28th and October 1st, alongside [AnsibleFest](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest). The first day (Tuesday, 28/9) is aimed at new contributors and people who want to understand what is involved in contributing. Day two (Friday, 1/10) will contain the usual interactive discussions with more technical details. If you'd like to help with the planning (especially with the content for day 1), please see this [issue](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/30).
