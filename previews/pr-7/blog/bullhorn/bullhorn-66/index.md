> ### Matrix Room Shields for repo READMEs?
> 
> I've opened an [example PR](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/pull/114) for displaying a Shields.io shield for a Matrix room inside the README of a repository. This is the same kind of thing as you often see for test coverage, code coverage, Python versions, etc.

> I think this is an useful extra way for maintainers to direct users to the right place to get help, and has the nice side-effect of demonstrating the large vibrant community we have. I'm looking to get feedback on whether this should go in the template repo, so that people know it's an option - what are your thoughts? Please [comment on the PR](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/pull/114)!
