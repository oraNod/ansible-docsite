## MAJOR NEW RELEASES üèÜÔ∏è

### Ansible-Core [‚Üó](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) ‚ö°Ô∏è

The `ansible-core` package contains the base engine and a small subset of modules and plugins. To see what's planned for the next release, look at the [`ansible-core` roadmaps](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/roadmap/ansible_core_roadmap_index.html).

[sivel](https://github.com/sivel) said

> [ansible-core 2.12.6 and ansible-core 2.11.12](https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-devel/c/qJLT-ekilPY) have been released. These are maintenance releases containing numerous bugfixes.

### Ansible [‚Üó](https://github.com/ansible-collections) üì¶Ô∏è

The `Ansible` package includes `ansible-core` and is a batteries-included package that provides a curated set of Ansible collections. See the [Ansible roadmaps](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/ansible_roadmap_index.html) for future release plans.

[dmsimard](https://matrix.to/#/@dmsimard:matrix.org) said

> Ansible 6.0.0b1 (including ansible-core 2.13.0) is now available for testing! It features, amongst other things, significantly improved installation performance on top of the latest updates from the included Ansible collections. This is a good opportunity to test the upcoming releases of both ansible and ansible-core and report feedback ahead of the stable release expected around 2022-06-21.
> 
> You can find the release announcement on [ansible-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-announce/c/r8JuHKaFZxw) and the changelog on [GitHub](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/6/CHANGELOG-v6.rst).

## PROPOSALS - DISCUSS AND VOTE! üó≥Ô∏è

[mariolenz](https://matrix.to/#/@mariolenz:matrix.org) contributed

> For people using the Ansible community package, there is no generic way to find out the version they are running. `ansible --version` just gives the ansible-core version, so they have to rely on their specific package manager (pip, dpkg, rpm...). If you think there should be a generic way, please add your views to the [CLI program which prints the Ansible package's version](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/89) discussion.

[hunleyd](https://matrix.to/#/@hunleyd:matrix.org) said

> The `community.postgresql` maintainers need your feedback! A proposal for formalizing the supported PG versions has been filed [here](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/issues/276) and needs your input. If adopted, the collection will issue major releases yearly and each major release will officially support the five major version of PG supported at that time. We think this will ultimately improve the collection and improve the end user's experience but *we need your input*. We look forward to hearing from everyone!

[dmsimard](https://matrix.to/#/@dmsimard:matrix.org) said

> If you happen to be using the ansible package from EPEL, we would appreciate your feedback on updating from 2.9 to the latest release of ansible 5. Please find [this thread](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/7RATG567ZHEY2TPJILDUNEKC23P25CZB/) for more information. Thank you!
