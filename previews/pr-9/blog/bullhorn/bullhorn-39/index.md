## GENERAL NEWS UPDATES

[Gwmngilfen](https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:ansible.im) shared

> ## Making community participation more inclusive
> 
> Hey there! The Ansible Community Working Group has been looking at how to make our discussion process more inclusive - currently we use a very real-time format which we recognise limits participation.
> 
> There is a discussion (and draft proposal) currently happening [on GitHub](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/38) as to how to improve this. We'd really love to get more feedback on what you'd like to see to improve the discussion in the Ansible Community. Please come talk to us, either on the GitHub Issue, or [here in chat](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com).

This collection builds on the modules available in pulp.squeezer, adding roles for repositories, publications, distributions and content guards, as well as one for creating Django users. This helps to reduce the boilerplate involved, and makes the configuration more ‘declarative’.
