## MAJOR NEW RELEASES

### Ansible [‚Üó](https://github.com/ansible-collections)

The `Ansible` package includes `ansible-core` and is a batteries-included package that provides a curated set of Ansible collections. See the [Ansible roadmaps](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/ansible_roadmap_index.html) for future release plans.

[dmsimard](https://matrix.to/#/@dmsimard:matrix.org) shared

> Ansible 5.5.0 has been released with updates to 19 collections! You can find more information about this new release in the [announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-announce/c/4sbFT7aVklY) and the [changelog](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/5/CHANGELOG-v5.rst).

## COLLECTION UPDATES

[andersson007_](https://matrix.to/#/@andersson007_:matrix.org) shared

> [community.mysql](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql) versions [2.3.5](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/blob/stable-2/changelogs/CHANGELOG.rst) and [3.1.2](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/blob/main/changelogs/CHANGELOG.rst) have been released.

[ashwini](https://matrix.to/#/@ashwini:libera.chat) shared

> The `ipaddr` filters are broken in `ansible.netcommon` 2.6.0 release as we have recently migrated `ipaddr` filters from `ansible.netcommon` to `ansible.utils`. We have released utils 2.5.2 and netcommon 2.6.1 which fixed these two issues ([ansible.netcommon#375](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.netcommon/issues/375), [ansible.utils#148](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.utils/issues/148)). For the [FQDN issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77192), the ansible-core team has already merged [the fix](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77210). This fix will be available in the March 28th release, which means that users of non fqdn ipaddr filters can use the old netcommon collection version 2.5.1 as a workaround until the next ansible-core release (March 28th) by the core-team. For fqdn ipaddr filters, users can use the latest versions of any of ansible.netcommon (2.6.1) or ansible.utils (2.5.2).

> `community.postgresql` 2.1.2 has been released with a new deprecation. ([changelog](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/blob/2.1.2/CHANGELOG.rst#v2-1-2))

[felixfontein](https://matrix.to/#/@felixfontein:libera.chat) shared

> community.general 4.6.0 has been released with new features and bugfixes ([changelog](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/stable-4/CHANGELOG.rst#v4-6-0)).
