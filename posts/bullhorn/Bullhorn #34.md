### CONTRIBUTOR SUMMIT & ANSIBLEFEST

The next **[Ansible Contributor Summit](https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109) will be on September 28th and October 1st**, alongside [AnsibleFest 2021](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest). Registration is open! Please **register on [Eventbrite](https://ansiblecs202109.eventbrite.com/?aff=bullhorn)** to stay informed of updates to the event. Note that the AnsibleFest registration is separate from the Contributor Summit.

The [first day (Tuesday, 28/9)](https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109#Day-1-Tuesday-September-28-2021) is aimed at new contributors and people who want to understand what is involved in contributing. [Day two (Friday, 1/10)](https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109#Day-2-Friday-October-1-2021) will contain the usual interactive discussions with more technical details.

In addition, we will be running a **[Hackathon](https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109#Hackathon)** in parallel throughout the week (Tuesday to Friday). This is for anyone with an interest in contributing to Ansible (with a focus on Collections), including those who have never contributed and are unsure of how to get started, existing contributors and maintainers, etc. all are welcome! Resources (people, labs, docs, etc.) will be available to help people through the entire process.

During AnsibleFest, we will have a **[Community Live Q&A](https://events.ansiblefest.redhat.com/widget/redhat/ansible21/sessioncatalog/session/1630700700190001PpLq) with members of the Ansible Community Team (Wednesday, Sep 29 @ 15:30-16:00 UTC)**. If you have pressing questions that you'd like us to answer/discuss, please suggest them in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/629).
