**ANSIBLE-CORE 2.12 RELEASE SCHEDULE**

The Ansible Core team has updated the [ansible-core roadmap](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_12.html) that will delay the release of 2.12 from 2021-10-25 to 2021-11-08.

The Ansible 5.0 community package [roadmap](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/COLLECTIONS_5.html) will have to be updated as well in order to take into account the planned changes. We will provide more information on the new plan soon.

**NEW/UPDATED COMMUNITY COLLECTIONS**

* Community General Collection - [community.general](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general) 3.4.0 has been released with new features and bugfixes.
* Community HashiVault Collection - [community.hashi_vault](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/hashi_vault) [1.3.2](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/releases/tag/1.3.2) has been released.
* Community libvirt Collection - [community.libvirt](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/libvirt) 1.0.2 has been released.
* ProxySQL collection for Ansible - [community.proxysql](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/proxysql) 1.1.0 has been released.

**ANNOUNCING NEW COLLECTION MAINTAINERS**

We are happy to announce that the [community.proxysql](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.proxysql) collection has found a new maintainer: [Markus Bergholz](https://github.com/markuman) (markuman on GitHub / IRC).

He has done an excellent job as a code contributor in different repositories under the `ansible` and `ansible-collections` organizations, as well as being a reviewer and an active community member.

On behalf of the Ansible Community and the Community Team, weâ€™d like to congratulate him on getting commit access, and say THANK YOU!

**LOOKING FOR COLLECTION MAINTAINERS/CONTRIBUTORS**

- The [community.rabbitmq](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.rabbitmq) collection is urgently looking for new maintainers. If you're interested, please respond in the [pinned issue](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.rabbitmq/issues/81).
- The [community.libvirt](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.libvirt) collection is urgently looking for new maintainers. If you're interested, please respond in the [pinned issue](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.libvirt/issues/78).

**ANSIBLE COMMUNITY AND MATRIX**

[Greg Sutcliffe](https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:ansible.im/) will be hosting a [Matrix Q&A](https://youtu.be/9R31zq_7R6c), next Tuesday August 3rd at [14:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Proposal%3A+Ansible+Community+to+accept+Matrix+as+an+equal+partner+to+IRC&iso=20210803T15&p1=136), as a way to test out a new method to run our conferences. The video stream will be on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9R31zq_7R6c), and chat will be held directly in our [IRC/Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.im), so folks will be able to play back both video and chat later if they wish.

**ANSIBLE GALAXY IMPORT CHANGES**

Please be aware that there's a change made in Ansible Galaxy to require mandatory `requires_ansible` in the `meta/runtime.yml` file for uploading a collection ([#122](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy-importer/pull/122), [#124](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy-importer/pull/124)). After you've added the collection, you will probably hit `ansible-test` failure in sanity checks if you use it with the `--venv` option, since it is unable to check this field due to the [failing requirement](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75353). You will need to have the `meta/runtime.yml` file now for your collection to be uploaded.

**COLLECTION INCLUSION CANDIDATES FOR ANSIBLE 5.0**

We are working towards adding new collections into Ansible 5.0.0, and you can track the progress of the various collections in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/32).

**ANSIBLE CONTRIBUTOR SUMMIT AND SURVEY** 

Thanks to those who have taken the time to fill in the [Contributor Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/3YBYKTS)! If you haven't done so, please take a few moments for [the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/3YBYKTS), we'd greatly appreciate it!

The [next Contributor Summit](https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109) will be on September 28th and October 1st, alongside [AnsibleFest](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest). The first day (Tuesday, 28/9) is aimed at new contributors and people who want to understand what is involved in contributing. Day two (Friday, 1/10) will contain the usual interactive discussions with more technical details. If you'd like to help with the planning (especially with the content for day 1), please see this [issue](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/30).
